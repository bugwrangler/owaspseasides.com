# CODE OF CONDUCT

OWASP is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone , regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion and actions such as deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organizers may take appropriate action, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

Conference staff will be available to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
