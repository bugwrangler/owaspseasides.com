# Call for Papers \(CFP\)

Have an awesome story to share - a recent hack, your Infosec journey, or cool bounty experiences? Come share your experiences and motivate others with your success stories or learn from the pitfalls you've had!

Just fill out the form below. Of course, you'll have to figure out how to get there and where you'll be when you're not busy having fun at OWASP Seasides. That's totally on you! Food and drinks on us and that's about it. Speakers will have to manage their stay and travel.

Still not sure or have more questions? You can reach us at: [cfpowaspseasides@owasp.org](mailto:cfpowaspseasides@owasp.org)
