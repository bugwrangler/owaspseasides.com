# CMD+CTRL Code/Web App Review Challenge

Security Innovation is teaming up with OWASP Seasides to offer attendees a fun "find the vulnerabilities" game - CMD+CTRL Cyber Range - that shows how hackers break into websites and teaches the importance of secure coding habits.

The CMD+CTRL Cyber Range we will be using is called ShadowBank, a banking website where players compete to find vulnerabilities, score points, and move up the leaderboard. "Leveraging cheat sheets, players take their shot at stealing money, manipulating share prices, and conducting other nefarious acts. "

NOTE: **Just bring your computer and evil inner-doer and you are ready to roll!**
