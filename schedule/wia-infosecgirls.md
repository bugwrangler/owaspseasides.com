**OWASP Women in Application Security \(WIA\) Committee**

The purpose of Women in AppSec \(WIA\) Committee is for anyone who believes that diversity is important to the success of the organisation, as well as for women looking to learn more about AppSec or who want to make career connections with like-minded colleagues. This includes female undergraduate and graduate students, instructors, and professionals who are dedicated to information security or application development.

**INFOSEC GIRLS**  
Our main objective is to get women curious about information security. We aim to do this by encouraging more women to actively participate in events like security conferences & community meet-ups. [https://www.infosecgirls.in/](https://www.infosecgirls.in/)
